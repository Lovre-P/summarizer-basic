## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with modern ES6+ features
- **Storage**: IndexedDB for local data persistence
- **AI**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash API for summarization
- **TTS**: Web Speech API for text-to-speech
- **PWA**: Service Worker for offline functionality and caching

### Content Extraction Strategy

1. **Direct Fetch**: Attempt to fetch content directly (works for CORS-enabled sites)
2. **CORS Proxy**: Use proxy services for sites that block direct access
3. **Manual Input**: Fallback to user-provided content
